    <p>
        My name is Stephen Magesty and I am a current employee with Build N Care. I work part-time as an ABA Therapist.
        I enrolled in this rutgers coding bootcamp because I would love to make a change in occupations and get into the
        tech world.
        I have been actively working with kids over the last few years through both my church and occupation.
        I hold a youth pastor position at my church, making me in charge of the childrens ministry.
        The reason I got into the ABA field was after I had the opportunity to work as an assistant to Steven Kunkel,
        who started "Life with Autism in a Non-Autistic World"
        in Kentucky three years ago. Steven is a man who started this company since he himself had to learn how to go
        through life
        "in a non-autistic world" as someone who is autistic. His goal was to create a community where the kids with
        autism in the
        Louisville area could get the attention and funding they deserve. This served as an extremely humbling
        experience to me during
        my short time in Kentucky. After coming back home to New Jersey after college, my goal was to pursue a job in
        that field.
