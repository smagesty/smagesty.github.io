    <p>
        My name is Stephen Magesty and I am a current employee with Build N Care. I work part-time as an ABA Therapist.
        I enrolled in this rutgers coding bootcamp because I would love to make a change in occupations and get into the
        tech world.
      </p>  

        <p>I have been actively working with kids over the last few years through both my church and occupation.
                I hold a youth pastor position at my church, making me in charge of the childrens ministry.
                The reason I got into the ABA field was after I had the opportunity to work as an assistant to Steven Kunkel,
                who started "Life with Autism in a Non-Autistic World" in Kentucky three years ago.</p>
                
        <p>Steven is a man who started this company since he himself had to learn how to go
        through life
        "in a non-autistic world" as someone who is autistic. His goal was to create a community where the kids with
        autism in the
        Louisville area could get the attention and funding they deserve. </p>
        
        <p>This served as an extremely humbling
        experience to me during
        my short time in Kentucky. After coming back home to New Jersey after college, my goal was to pursue a job in
        that field.
    </p>
